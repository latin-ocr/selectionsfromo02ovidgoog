horas ON THE MORE munaum· PASSAGES.

Hcr. i. 15 : sivo quis Antilochum narrabat ab 11001010 victum. Two ob-
jections have been made to the reading ab Hectore: (1) according to
Homer, it was not Hector, but Memnon, that killed Antilochus. (2) ab
Hectora, following Hectoreo iu the preceding line, gives offense.

The second objection does not streugthen the first at all. For, while
the repetition is awkward and striking, 11 would be quite as awkward to
jump from Hector in 14 10 sornebody else in 15 and back to Hector iu 16.
The general assertion in 14 11111 naturally be illustratori aud explained in
the next verses. .

Is it possible that Ovid, with his great memory‚ carefuluesa and ao-
ouraey, overlooked this point iu Homer aad wrote ab Hectore without any
authority 101 it 1 it seems so to me (01. my Souacas 01 Ovid's Heroides,
p. 16), aud in the absence 01 a better reading Ι have retained 0111001010
in the text.

If any change is to bc made, it should bc rather in the word Antilochum.
For instance, Amphimachum might be substituted. See lionam, Il. xr11.

Her. xii. 17:

semina iecisset, totidem visurus 0111001011,
1100110101, etc.

Instead 01 visurus, the best MSS. give qne ot uomina (Ρ.) 01 quot seminat
((1.) The readings seem 10 have come from quot semina, which is prob-
ably a gloss explaining totidem, and replaced some verb which cannot be
restored with great confidence. The passage has been variously emended,
most editors putting iu some word like sevisset. The construction 01
this sevisset would naturally hc the same as that 01 the preceding iecisset
(01· 10110001, 00 several editors have 11), but that does not fit the sense well.
Hc 0119111 to 1111110οο1111 0110111111 number of 0110111100 does not seem to he
the meaning, hut rather 1101101111 1101000111, stating that the one action
was involved in the other. it ia, moreover, not quite correct to say
hostes sorore when you simply mean that hostes spring up from the sow-
ing. Ι am prepared to grant that these are both rather fine points¹ but
they are sufficient to cavvse mc to suggesta new emendation, visnrus.
The word video is peculiarly applicabis 10 the strange sight. Compare
1. 98111111 Met. 111. 130, 135.
