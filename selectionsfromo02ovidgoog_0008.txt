PREFAOE.

Tms book is designed primarily to serve asan introductiou to
Latin poetry, ior which Ovid seems to be peculiarly well adapted
because his style is comparatively easy and his subject matter inter-
esting.

The text oi the Metamorphoses isin the main that oi Magnus
(1896). The Heroides were printed from the critical edition oi
Sedlmayer (1888). In certain cases Ihave not hesitated to deviato
from these editions in favor oi a reading that seemed to be better.
Where it seemed desirable to explain these changes more fully, I
have done so in the Commentary or in the Oritical Notes at the end
oi the Commentary.

In the Commentary I have endeavored to give all the inionnation
necessary to an intelhgent reading oi the text, without the addition
oi extraneous matter unsuitable ior those studente for whom the
book is intended. At the same time, remembering that the place oi
Ovid in college curricula is not yet fixed and that many read him in
inore advanccd classe‘sft have tried to prepare an edition which
might be profitably used by that class oi studente also.

The Proverbs and Short Selectious at the close oi the text have
been added, not only for their· own intrinsic merit but also to afford
material ior sight translation‘where the teacher may find it desirablc.

The Commentary on the ⁴second part hasbeen made as full as that
on the first part, so that teachcrs who feel 'so disposed may begin with
the Heroides instead oi the Metamorphoses.

All the most important editions have been consultcd in the
preparation oi this edition. For the Metamorphoses, the editions oi
Magnus (1896), Harder (1897), Meuser-Egen (1898), Siebelis-Polle
(1888), and Haupt were found most useiul. For the Heroides, 1 have
drawn most from Palmer (ad ed, 1898), Schuckburgh (1879), and
Loers (1829). For the Vocabulary‚ Iam under especial obligations

‘ . to stabelis-Pohe (1893) anu Petere (1894).

Acknowledgments are due to Professors Gildersleeve and Lodge‚
the editors-in-chiei oi this series, for their assistance in reading the
proci and ior various suggestions in the Commentary.
