the Muses, and now the success of some early love-poema
fired his genius and changed his life. ,Henceforth he dc-
voted himself to poetry and a life of literary ease. Sucha
life he loved above all others, and fortunately his circnm-
stances were such that he was able to indulge himself. Tho
greater part of his life was passed under exceptionally happy
circumstances. The consciens productiones immortal works
must in itself have-been the source of great satisfaction to
the author. Besides this, Ovid had friends and congenial

companions among the poeta and other prominent men of ¹

Rome.

After two unhappy marriages, Ovid found in his third
wife ‚a companion upon whom he bestowed great praise in his
poema. He had a daughter, it is uncertain by which wife.

When the poet was fifty years old and his hair was well
sprinkled with gray, suddenly there came upon him, like a
thnnderbolt from a clear sky, a decree from the hand of Au-
gustus banishing him to the town of Tomi, on the Black Sea,
near the mouth ,of the Danube. The cause cithia decree is
not known. Ovid everywhere says that his fault or mistake
did not amount to a crime.

Ovid took a sorrowiul farewell of his friends and family
and of the city which he loved so well. After a long and

tedicus journey he arrived athis destination, the home of .

the barbarous Getae. There, amid very uncongenial sur-
roundings, he passed the remaining years of his life ; and
there he died, unpardoned, in the year 17 Ab. (according to
some, 18 an), at the age of fifty-nine (or slxty).

Ovid’s chief works were as follows :

1. Amores, three books of short poems on various subjecta,
but mainly love-poems addressed to Corinna, the fictitious
name of Ovid’s mistress.

2. Heroidea, twenty-one epistles, mainly imaginary love-
letters from· famous woman of the heroic age ,to their absent
husbands or lovers. ,
,Α 3. Ars Amatoria, in three books, in form didactic, con,-
veying instructions to men and women how to gain the affec·-
tions of the opposite sex.
