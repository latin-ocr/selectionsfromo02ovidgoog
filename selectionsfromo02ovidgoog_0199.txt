178 conunnrrnr.

Her. xii. 65 ε petit altera at alter habebit. The first hand ot P(the best
MS.) gives : alter peut alter habebit. 'rhis is defended by Salmasius and
Birt, and edited hy Sedlmayer. The secon'd hand of P gives: petit
altera etaltera habebit. θ reads the same, with habebit as a correction.
The various editors read as follows :

Bentley: petit altera, et alter habebat.

Merkel ε petit altera, et altera hahebat.

Riese r petit altera, at altera habebat.

Housman: alter petit, <impetrat> alter.

Some inferior MS. gives the reading l have adopted.

'l'he difficulty comes from supposing that alteria)...th(a) must
refer to the two sisters. 'l'he line, in itself, is obscuro. 'l'he light, it
seems, must come from the following line.

Her. xii. 143: frequenter. Several editors (as Merkel, Riese) rcad ire·
quentant on the authority of (ἱ and other MSS. lt seems, however, that
the notion of repetition belongs as well to Hymen as to Hymenaee.

Her. xii. 149:

(turn minor a pueris-ia tractus amore videndi
constitit ad geminae limina prima foria.

I have ventured an emendation. Instead of is tractus amore, the best
MSS. gire ustassai studioque, which is unintelligible. Various efforts.
have been made to amend the passage, but they are all unsatisfactory.
Every editor has attempted to give two motives why the boy took his
stand at the door, but one seems quite sufficient. Studio may well have
been a gloss and que inserted for metra. An expressed subject (te) for
the parenthetical clause is very desirable.

Iler. xii. 151: huo mihi, mater, adi. I have again dared to amend.
Nearly nil thc editors follow the best MSS. and read: hino inihi, mater,
abi. Thc meaning, however, cannot well be other than that given, and
it is very doubtful if hine abi can, without great distortion of langua'ge
mean anything else than 9⁰ away from here. It seems probable that
some grammarian-copyist thought this the appropriate thing for tho
child to say, and corrected accordingly.
