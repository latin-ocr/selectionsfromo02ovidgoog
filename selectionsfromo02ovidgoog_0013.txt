Greek and Iatin versification is based on the length ot
syllables, and not on the word-accent as in our language.
syllables arc either long (,-) or short (ν), or common (some-
times long, sometimes short, z). One long syllable is equal
to two shorts. The length of a syllable is called its quantity.
The Latin quantities must usually be learned by careful
observation, but some useful rules may be given:

1. A vowel before another vowel (or separated from it
only bylr) is usually short, eg. meus, paler.

2. A short vowel coming before two consonants, either in
the same word or in different words, counts as long, and the
syllable is said to be long by position. A double consonant
(c or a) has the same effect as two consonante.

3. Π these two-consonante bc a mute and a liquid (tr, br,
etc), the syllable may romain shert3 eg. tenebrae Such
syllables are usually common.

4. All diphthongo are long.

Some other rulos may be conveniently subjoined here ε

5. Sometimes two vowels, not naturally forming a diph-
thong, are in ¹pronunciation run together-into one syllable,
egdemde. This process is called Syac‘zcsc’s or synvaerests.

6. Hiatus is the coming together ot two vowel soundS,
one at the end ot a word, the other at tha beginning ol the
next word. In Ovid this is, as a rulo, permitted only when
the first word is a monosyllabis interjection or a polysyllabic

χ proper name ending with the ictus-syllable of the fifth foot.

In other cases this unpleasant juxtaposition of vowel sounds
is avoided by eliminating one of those sounds.
u. Usually the first vowel sound is omitted by Elisson ;
eg. pronounce perque hiemes as perquiomoa
- b. thn the second word is cs or cst of the verb sum, the
a is omitted by Apbccresc's ; eg. pronounce itum est as itumst.
