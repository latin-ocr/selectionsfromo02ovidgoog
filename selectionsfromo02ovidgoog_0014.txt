THE Dscmlc HEXAMETER.

The metra in which the Metamorphoses is written is
called the Dactylic Hexameter, or Heroic Hexameter, or
simply Hexameter.

'Phe Dactyl is a foot consisting of one long and two short

syllables, thus: a υ υ. The rhythmical acoent on the
first syllable of this scot is called the Ictus, and the syl·
labie upon which the Ictus falls is called the Thasie. The
remainder of the foetis called the Arsa* The Dactylic
Hexameter is, theoretically‚ averse consisting of six Dactyls.
The last leot, however, always consiste of but two syllables,
ι υ or a -. The fifth Dactyl is very rarely replaced by
aspondee (ι -). When this occurs, the verse is called a
Spondaie Versa. Any of the other four Dactyls may be
freely replaced by Spondees. So the ieet and syllables of a
Dactylic Hexameter would be as follows :
This long verse, if read without a pause, would grow monot-
onous. Usually there is a pause near the middle of the
verse, giving the effect rather of two short verses. This
pause usually coincides with the Principal (laesura. (laesura
(cutting) takes place whenever the end oi the word does not
coincide with the end of the ioot. When the (laesura eomes
immediately after the ictus-syllable, itis called musculiue ,·
when it eomes after one of the short syllables, it is called
feminiae. The Principal (laesura is the Semtqus'uors‘o, or
Penthemimeral, oecurring iu the middle of the third foot.
The next in importance is tbe Semisepteaors'u, or Heptathe-
ou‘msrul, in the middle of the fourth foot. When this occurs,
there is usually combined with it the Semtteroorio or Trita·
mimerol Gaesura in the middle oi the second foot. Often
there is a ohoice of (laesuras, and the reader in selecting the
pause should have regard ior the punctuation end sense.

* These tersus are sometimes used in just the opposite signification.
